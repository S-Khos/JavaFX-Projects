This folder/repository includes all exercies of assignment 1.
Each folder is a *project* made under Intellij.
In order to view the code and compile each program,
add the folder to project and open it as a project then run
respective java (class file).

For Letter Histogram, there is a txt file called test.txt
located within the project file. this makes it so you can
process the txt file in the program by just typing its name
since the present working directory of the program file
is the project folder.
